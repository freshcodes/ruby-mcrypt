  #
  # <tt>padding_type.to_s</tt> should be one of:
  #
  # ["pkcs","pkcs5","pkcs7"]
  #   Use pkcs5/7 padding which is safe for use with arbitrary binary
  #   inputs (as opposed to null-terminated C-strings). Each byte of
  #   padding contains the number of bytes of padding used. For example,
  #   if 5 bytes of padding are needed, each byte has the value 0x05. See
  #   {RFC 2315}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315#page-22] for a more
  #   detailed explanation. Padding is <em>always</em> added to
  #   disambiguate an incomplete message from one that happens to fall on
  #   block boundaries.
  #
  # ["zeros","zeroes"]
  #   Pads the plaintext with NUL characters. This works fine with C-
  #   strings. Don't use it with anything that might have other embedded
  #   nulls.
  #
  # ["none"]
  #   No padding is used. Will throw exceptions if the input size does
  #   not fall on block boundaries.
  #
  # You can also pass +true+ (which means "pkcs") or +false+ (no
  # padding). No padding is used by default.

  # N.B. This is not a feature of libmcrypt but of this Ruby module.
