= Mcrypt - libmcrypt bindings for Ruby

Mcrypt provides Ruby-language bindings for libmcrypt(3), a
symmetric cryptography library. {Libmcrypt}[http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/]
supports lots of different ciphers and encryption modes.

== You will need

* A working Ruby installation (>= 1.8.6 or 1.9 or 2.0)
* A working libmcrypt installation (2.5.x or 2.6.x, tested with 2.5.8)
* A sane build environment

== Installation

Install the gem:
  gem install ruby-mcrypt --test -- --with-mcrypt-dir=/path/to/mcrypt/prefix

If you're installing on Ubuntu: 
  sudo apt-get install mcrypt libmcrypt-dev
  gem install ruby-mcrypt

If you want to run the longer test suite, do this instead:
  MCRYPT_TEST_BRUTE=1 \
  gem install ruby-mcrypt --test -- --with-mcrypt-dir=/path/to/mcrypt/prefix

Put this in your code:
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mcrypt'

Or in Rails' environment.rb:
  gem "ruby-mcrypt", :lib => "mcrypt"

== Usage

  crypto = Mcrypt.new(:twofish, :cbc, MY_KEY, MY_IV, :pkcs)

  # encryption and decryption in one step
  ciphertext = crypto.encrypt(plaintext)
  plaintext  = crypto.decrypt(ciphertext)

  # encrypt in smaller steps
  while chunk = $stdin.read(4096)
    $stdout << crypto.encrypt_more(chunk)
  end
  $stdout << crypto.encrypt_finish

  # or decrypt:
  while chunk = $stdin.read(4096)
    $stdout << crypto.decrypt_more(chunk)
  end
  $stdout << crypto.decrypt_finish

== Known Issues

* Test coverage is lacking.

If you find any bugs, please let the author know.

== Wish List

* IO-like behavior, e.g. crypto.open($stdin) { |stream| ... }
